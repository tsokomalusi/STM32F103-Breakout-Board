# STM32F103-Breakout-Board

## Acknowledgements 
The PCB design of this STM32F103 breakout board was inspired by Philip Salmony [Phil's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLwKgMBWhpY&list=PLXSyc11qLa1b9VA7nw8-DiLRXVhZ2iUN2&index=11).
I reverse-engineered it a bit by adding an SWD connector and ESD protection IC
to  make routing a bit more challenging.
